It is discussed in chapter 3.

To use this project, create an instance of class NumberDisplay. Then inspect this 
instance and leave the inspector window open. With the inspector window open, 
call the object's methods, such as increment and setValue.

6. An increment should be transfered from minute to hour after it has rolled over 60 minutes (its limit), to increment +1 hour.
8. No, when the value is lower then 3 it gives the output, but when the value is higher then 10 no output is submitted in the Terminal Window.
9. Both values resulted in 0 since both values were only set to 10 and not given 10 increments. 
10. It is calling the method and not the object whioch is why it doesn't work out or it gives an error.
11. Missing a .class to process the information/command.
12. It lets you reach the limit without you reseting it.
13.
